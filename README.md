1) No, I would not use a unit test to test the messaging feature in a messaging app because this feature involves complex interactions, which unit tests aren't designed to handle efficiently. Unit tests are designed for isolated units or functions, not for testing such complex interactions. 

2) Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because unit tests are effective for testing small, isolated functionality that can be easily tested without external dependencies. By providing various input scenarios and verifying expected behavior, unit tests ensure the correct implementation of this feature.
