1) Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because unit tests are suitable for testing individual parts of code, such as functions or methods, to ensure they work correctly.

2) Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because unit tests are effective for testing specific functionality, like verifying that the message length limit is enforced correctly.
